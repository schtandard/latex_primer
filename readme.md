# A LaTeX Primer

In the past, I have frequently given TeXnical support to others.
While I enjoy spreading the good news of LaTeX, repeating the same general advice over and over started getting rather time-consuming and a bit tiresome.
For everyone who knows me, this document is meant to replace that initial session of conveying basic knowledge and good practices as well as serve as a reference for these things.
It is _not_ meant to discourage you from approaching me with questions or problems regarding LaTeX, though I may refuse to explain things contained in this document.
For everyone else, I hope that this may serve you as a valuable read and as a useful reference.
I do however have to ask you not to contact me with questions or issues, as I am unable to provide large-scale LaTeX~support.
