# A LaTeX Primer

## Abstract
In the past, I have frequently given TeXnical support to others.
While I enjoy spreading the good news of LaTeX, repeating the same general advice over and over started getting rather time-consuming and a bit tiresome.
This document is meant to replace that initial session of conveying basic knowledge and good practices as well as serve as a reference for these things.
It is _not_ meant to discourage you from approaching me with questions or problems regarding LaTeX, though I may refuse to explain things contained in this document.

## Using This Repository
This repository is meant to serve as a convenient way to keep your local copy of the primer up to date.
Though it will remain available on `exp2data`, copying it from there does not allow to easily check for new versions and copying them.

To clone the repository to your hard drive, run
```bash
git clone https://pit2.am14.uni-tuebingen.de/git/beneiii/latex_primer.git
```
When you want to update to the most recent revision, just run
```bash
git pull
```
in the repository.
